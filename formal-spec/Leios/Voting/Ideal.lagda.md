## An ideal model of the Leios voting scheme (first cut)

This module is a first step towards
[#689 "Formalize correctness of certificates"](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/issues/689).

It gives an *ideal* model of voting as a small state machine and states — and
proves — the central correctness property:

> **If a certificate for a block exists, then at least one honest node has
> validated that block.**

The ideal functionality records a vote for a block only under the premise that the
voter validated the block (for honest parties) or that the voter is dishonest (for
adversarial parties). A *certificate* is a quorum of `threshold`-many distinct
voters. As long as the adversary controls fewer than `threshold` parties, any
certifying set must contain an honest voter, whose recorded vote carries the
validation evidence — so the property holds by construction of the ideal.

Compared to the opaque `isVoteCertified` field of `Leios.Voting.VotingAbstract`,
here the certificate predicate (`Certified`) is *derived* from the recorded votes
and an explicit `threshold`. Folding this refinement back into the shared
`VotingAbstract` (which `SpecStructure`/`Protocol`/`Blockchain.Safety` depend on)
is the follow-up "composable state machine" refactor and is intentionally left out
of this first cut to avoid destabilising the rest of the build.

The model is parameterised over an abstract notion of party, block reference, a
(decidable) honesty predicate, a validation predicate, and the certificate
threshold.

```agda
module Leios.Voting.Ideal
  (Party      : Type)
  (EBRef      : Type)
  (honest     : Party → Type) ⦃ _ : honest ⁇¹ ⦄
  (Validated  : Party → EBRef → Type)
  (threshold  : ℕ)
  where
```

### A combinatorial pigeonhole lemma

A duplicate-free list contained in another list is no longer than it. This is the
counting core of the correctness argument: a quorum of distinct voters cannot fit
inside a strictly smaller set of corrupt parties.

```agda
private
  ∈-remove : ∀ {A : Type} {z x : A} (ys zs : List A)
           → z ∈ˡ ys ++ x ∷ zs → z ≢ x → z ∈ˡ ys ++ zs
  ∈-remove ys zs z∈ z≢x with ∈-++⁻ ys z∈
  ... | inj₁ z∈ys         = ∈-++⁺ˡ z∈ys
  ... | inj₂ (here z≡x)   = ⊥-elim (z≢x z≡x)
  ... | inj₂ (there z∈zs) = ∈-++⁺ʳ ys z∈zs

  unique-⊆⇒length≤ : ∀ {A : Type} {xs ys : List A}
                   → Unique xs → (∀ {z} → z ∈ˡ xs → z ∈ˡ ys) → length xs N.≤ length ys
  unique-⊆⇒length≤ {xs = []}     _                _   = N.z≤n
  unique-⊆⇒length≤ {xs = x ∷ xs} (x≢ AllPairs.∷ u) sub with ∈-∃++ (sub (here refl))
  ... | ys₁ , ys₂ , refl =
    subst (λ n → suc (length xs) N.≤ n)
          (sym (trans (length-++ ys₁) (N.+-suc (length ys₁) (length ys₂))))
          (N.s≤s (subst (λ n → length xs N.≤ n) (length-++ ys₁) (unique-⊆⇒length≤ u sub')))
    where
      sub' : ∀ {z} → z ∈ˡ xs → z ∈ˡ ys₁ ++ ys₂
      sub' {z} z∈ = ∈-remove ys₁ ys₂ (sub (there z∈)) (λ z≡x → All.lookup x≢ z∈ (sym z≡x))
```

### The ideal functionality

The state is just the log of votes cast so far.

```agda
record IdealState : Type where
  constructor ⟨_⟩
  field voteLog : List (Party × EBRef)

open IdealState

init : IdealState
init = ⟨ [] ⟩

Voted : Party → EBRef → IdealState → Type
Voted p eb st = (p , eb) ∈ˡ voteLog st
```

A step either records an honest vote — only permitted once the voter has validated
the block — or an adversarial vote from a dishonest party.

```agda
data Step : IdealState → IdealState → Type where
  CastHonest : ∀ {st p eb} → honest p → Validated p eb
             → Step st ⟨ (p , eb) ∷ voteLog st ⟩
  CastAdv    : ∀ {st p eb} → ¬ honest p
             → Step st ⟨ (p , eb) ∷ voteLog st ⟩
```

The functionality maintains the invariant that every honest recorded vote is backed
by a validation. This is what makes the ideal model *ideal*.

```agda
WF : IdealState → Type
WF st = ∀ {p eb} → Voted p eb st → honest p → Validated p eb

wf-init : WF init
wf-init ()

wf-step : ∀ {st st'} → WF st → Step st st' → WF st'
wf-step wf (CastHonest hp val) (here refl) hq = val
wf-step wf (CastHonest hp val) (there v)   hq = wf v hq
wf-step wf (CastAdv ¬hp)       (here refl) hq = ⊥-elim (¬hp hq)
wf-step wf (CastAdv ¬hp)       (there v)   hq = wf v hq
```

### Certificates and correctness

A certificate is a quorum of `threshold`-many *distinct* parties that have all voted
for the block.

```agda
record Certified (st : IdealState) (eb : EBRef) : Type where
  field
    voters : List Party
    unique : Unique voters
    voted  : All.All (λ p → Voted p eb st) voters
    quorum : threshold N.≤ length voters
```

If the certificate's quorum is larger than the set of corrupt parties, one of the
voters must be honest.

```agda
∃honestVoter :
    (voters : List Party) → Unique voters
  → (corrupt : List Party) → length corrupt N.< length voters
  → (∀ {p} → p ∈ˡ voters → ¬ honest p → p ∈ˡ corrupt)
  → ∃[ p ] (p ∈ˡ voters × honest p)
∃honestVoter voters uniq corrupt corrupt<voters cov with Any.any? ¿ honest ¿¹ voters
... | yes h = find∈ h
... | no ¬h = ⊥-elim (N.<-irrefl refl (N.≤-<-trans (unique-⊆⇒length≤ uniq sub) corrupt<voters))
  where
    sub : ∀ {z} → z ∈ˡ voters → z ∈ˡ corrupt
    sub {z} z∈ = cov z∈ (All.lookup (¬Any⇒All¬ voters ¬h) z∈)
```

The main property: a certificate implies an honest node validated the block. The
adversary is modelled by a list `corrupt` of parties it controls, assumed smaller
than the quorum threshold (this is the honest-participation assumption); every
dishonest voter must be one of them.

```agda
cert-correct : ∀ {st eb}
  → WF st
  → (corrupt : List Party)
  → (∀ {p} → Voted p eb st → ¬ honest p → p ∈ˡ corrupt)
  → length corrupt N.< threshold
  → Certified st eb
  → ∃[ p ] (honest p × Validated p eb)
cert-correct {st} {eb} wf corrupt corrupt-covers bound cert =
  let open Certified cert
      (p , p∈voters , hp) =
        ∃honestVoter voters unique corrupt (N.<-≤-trans bound quorum)
          (λ q∈ ¬hq → corrupt-covers (All.lookup voted q∈) ¬hq)
  in p , hp , wf (All.lookup voted p∈voters) hp
```
